This is my blog site code and contents.

Working with GitHub Pages
---

This Jekyll site is meant to be deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). GitHub Pages automatically deploys __master__ branch content, so use other branches to draft content and test it locally with Docker.


Testing with Docker
---

There is a Docker, [malkab/Docker-Jekyll](https://hub.docker.com/r/malkab/jekyll/), to do local testing before uploading. Use the __docker-run.sh__ script to test and head to __http://localhost:4000__.
